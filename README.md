# Data Engineering

Data engineering is the aspect of data science that focuses on practical applications of data collection and analysis. Before a company can optimize the business more efficiently or build data products more intelligently, layers of foundational work need to be built first. 

These projects will cover the different aspects within the data engineering pipeline, such as 

* **writing** events to *Kafka* topics
* **filtering & separating** events with *Spark*
* **storing** events in *Hadoop* (HDFS)
* **querying** events with *SQL*
